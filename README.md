# My Website

This is my personal website, built using Jekyll and the Pixyll theme.

The CV markdown page and accompanying PDF file are also hosted separately on GitHub. As my CV is updated these files are moved over and made available directly from my website.

This folder contains files for Research and Outreach specific pages. To add these pages to the navigation menu, simply add their title to the page tags and the navigation menu will be able to find it. Until more content can be added I have chosen to hide these pages from the main view.
