I was recognized as one of 199 finalists for the 2017 Truman Scholarship, after being nominated by Drexel to apply. 

>The [Truman Scholarship](https://www.truman.gov) was established as a living memorial to the 33rd president of the United States and recognizes students committed to a career in public service and will become a self described "change agent". Scholars are chosen based on their academic and community service record and long term plans for graduate studies and a career in public service.
