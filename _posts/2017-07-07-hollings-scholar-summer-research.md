This past summer I worked for NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information in Boulder, CO. This was made possible through the Hollings Scholarship Program that I had applied to last year. For my research I was developing a new global relief model to replace the current version published in 2009, ETOPO1. My experience was highlighted by the NCEI team on their blog.
