The National Climate Assessment is a collaborative effort by over a dozen government agencies in coordination with the White House to identify and describe the impact of climate change to the nation. I worked in the USGCRP office this past summer through the Truman Scholarship program and was able to be a contributor as the report was finalized for publication. It was a great experience to see how multiple agencies work together on large, comprehensive reports and gave me an appreciation for that process. The report is available as a large PDF, but interestingly it was primarly written as bite sized chapters made available as interactive websites and the authors expect most people to read the report in this format instead of more traditional paper copies.
