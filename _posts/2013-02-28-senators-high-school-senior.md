>I know I speak for all West Virginians in congratulating our native Wheeling student, Vincent O’Leary, on becoming a finalist in one of the most prestigious pre-college science competitions in the country. Vincent Jacob not only contributed his valuable research to the science community, but his drive, discipline and talent demonstrate true leadership skills. I wish Vincent only the best, and I am confident that this impressive achievement will surely lead to many other great accomplishments in the future.

Senator Joe Manchin

>West Virginia’s students have shown time and time again just how innovative they are. And that innovation, especially in science and related fields, is at the heart of West Virginia’s economic future. Vincent is proof that West Virginia and its students have what it takes to compete on a national level. I know he will make his school, family, and our state proud.

Senator Jay Rockefeller
