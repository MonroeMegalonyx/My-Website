I was nominated by Drexel for the Gaither Junior Fellows Program in 2018. I am applying to connect policy to my research in climate change and biodiversity as a Junior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment's Energy and Climate Program.

>The [Gaither Junior Fellows Program](http://carnegieendowment.org/about/jr-fellows) is a highly competitive award that enables recent graduates to work for a year with a senior fellow in one of the program areas of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
