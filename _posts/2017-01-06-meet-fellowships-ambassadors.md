I’ve been working with the Drexel Fellowships Office for several years now, most recently to apply for the Truman and Udall national fellowships. This year I will be a student ambassador to encourage other students to apply as well and act as a representative for the office.

> Vince O’Leary (BS Environmental Science & Geoscience ’18, Honors) believes “Even for rejections, the time spent on applications was invaluable to me and helped me ask tough questions about my future and my accomplishments at Drexel. Just as co-ops can help students get experience in the field and think about what they are doing, fellowships help students think about why they even want to do that”.
