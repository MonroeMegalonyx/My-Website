I am a student ambassador for the Drexel Fellowships Office now!

> Vince O’Leary (BS Environmental Science & Geoscience ’18, Honors) believes “Even for rejections, the time spent on applications was invaluable to me and helped me ask tough questions about my future and my accomplishments at Drexel. Just as co-ops can help students get experience in the field and think about what they are doing, fellowships help students think about why they even want to do that”.
