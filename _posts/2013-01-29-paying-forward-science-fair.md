I was recently recognized as a finalist for the [Intel Science Talent Search 2013](http://www.societyforscience.org/STS) and spoke with West Liberty University about the importance of my mentor, Dr. Zach Loughman. I have been working with Dr. Loughman for years on this science fair project.

>Any time he needed anything he would email or call, and we would discuss issues he was having. I was completing my Ph.D. at that time, and would call my academic adviser to discuss dissertation issues, hang up the phone, and then get a phone call from Vincent and have the same level conversation with him. Vincent truly works at a different level than most high school students.
