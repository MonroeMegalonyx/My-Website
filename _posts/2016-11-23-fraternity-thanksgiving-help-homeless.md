Every year for more than 15 years my fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, has spent the day before Thanksgiving preparing about 100 home cooked meals for the homeless as well as 911 call center employees. I was lucky enough to be in charge of the event in 2015, and it was one of the highlights of my time in Phi Psi. This year CBS Philly joined us before 7:00AM to watch how the all the meals come together.
