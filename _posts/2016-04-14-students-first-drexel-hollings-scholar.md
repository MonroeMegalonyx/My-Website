I was one of the first students at Drexel, alongside Nick Barber, to receive the NOAA Hollings Scholarship. This award will support my research and education in environmental science.

>The NOAA Hollings Scholarship is awarded annually to students seeking careers in oceanic and atmospheric science, research, technology and education, in honor of long-time South Carolina Senator Ernest F. Hollings. Hollings served in Congress for 36 years, where he was instrumental in the creation of NOAA and was an advocate in creating legislation designed to protect the worldâ€™s oceans.
