I am excited to share my first publication in a scientific journal, "Georeferencing for Research Use (GRU): An integrated geospatial training paradigm for biocollections researchers and data providers." This article came from an idea at an iDigBio workshop on georeferencing collection materials, and describes best practices and topics covered by the workshop so everyone will be able to learn about it.
