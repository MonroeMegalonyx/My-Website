I've worked for several years on a science fair project exploring the effects of invasive crayfish in West Virginia. In that time I have been awarded over $150,000 in awards and scholarships, and have been lucky enough to travel around the country to compete at the national and internation level. These opportunities were invaluable to prepare me for college and have hands on experience in research. Recently I spoke to the Wheeling Intelligencer about my science fair journey.

>I’m amazed at what he’s done. I noticed there’s been such a growth in him as a student and also as an individual. If you bring up a topic and he’s curious about it, he’ll go as a far as he needs to go to discover the answer to the question. I think he really is inquisitive and willing to take the risk and do the leg work to find out the answers. He’s amazing. He’s a great kid.
