I was selected as one of 62 Truman Scholars for 2017, and the first student from Drexel University to ever receive the award.

>The [Truman Scholarship](https://www.truman.gov) was established as a living memorial to the 33rd president of the United States and recognizes students committed to a career in public service and will become a self described "change agent". Scholars are chosen based on their academic and community service record and long term plans for graduate studies and a career in public service.
