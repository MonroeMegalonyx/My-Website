I am one of four Drexel nominees for the 2017 Udall Scholarship.

>The [Udall Scholarship](http://www.udall.gov/OurPrograms/Scholarship/AboutScholarship.aspx) was established to recognize college sophomores and juniors that demonstrated their commitment to the environment through participation on campus and service to the community. The award also recognizes students working in areas of tribal policy and native health care. It is awarded by the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation.
