The Society for Science and the Public is the organization that supports and organizes many of the science fairs I participated in as a high school student. These programs were my first experience doing research and presenting results. They featured part of my earlier interview in a column alongside other alumni.

>"The classroom should not be the end of your learning. Whether you go home and read, debate with peers, do research, work online, whatever, you cannot allow yourself to stop learning once school is over. Learning should happen every second of every day and the only thing you need to do to be a scientist or mathematician is to keep asking why, and occasionally writing down the answer so you can get published and get other people to ask why."
