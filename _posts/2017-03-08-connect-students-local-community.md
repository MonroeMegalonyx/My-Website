The University City Review highlighted the work I'm involved with to teach local elementary students STEM topics. Through a special course at Drexel, students visit the classrooms and prepare lessons for the children to participate in. I'm currently working as the Drexel Community Scholar to support and expand this program to more students and schools. Currently we offer classes in Physics, Math, and Biology.
