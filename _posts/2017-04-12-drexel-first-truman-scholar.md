I am honored and humbled to be named Drexel's first ever Truman Scholar. 

>As a 2017 Truman Scholar, Vincent is one of just 62 students selected nationwide from a pool of 768 candidates nominated by 315 colleges and universities. These scholars were chosen by sixteen independent selection panels based on the finalistsâ€™ academic success and leadership accomplishments, as well as their likelihood of becoming public service leaders. Vincent will receive up to $30,000 for graduate study, as well as priority admission and supplemental funding at selected premier graduate institutions. Scholars also receive leadership training, career and graduate school counseling, and special internship opportunities within the federal government, in addition to joining a powerful network of Truman Scholar alumni.
