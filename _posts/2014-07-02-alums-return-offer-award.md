The Society for Science and the Public is the organization that supports and organizes many of the science fairs I participated in as a high school student. These programs were my first experience doing research and presenting results. This month I returned with several of my peers as alumni to present an award at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angelos. I spoke to them afterwards about the experience and why we returned.
