I am Vincent O'Leary, an undergraduate student at Drexel working with data to understand the planet.

<h2> My Planet </h2>

Minor Planet 28592 “O’Leary” was discovered March 11, 2000 by the Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth Asteroid Research Team at Socorro and named for after me February 28, 2013. It was named for being a finalist in the Intel (now Regeneron) Science Talent Search in 2013.
